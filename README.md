## Overview
- Free Tomorrow was designed to allow busy users to easily plan vacations with their equally busy friends. Using Free Tomorrow, users simply select their availability for a vacation and the budget they can afford, and share the generated URL with their friends. The user that receives the URL then visits their dashboard to view a notification for the invitation. After confirming that the dates and budget proposed by the sender are line in with their constraints, the trip is added to their account.

## Install & Setup
* Visit deployed site [here](https://freetomorrow.netlify.app/)
Or:
1. Clone this down
2. `cd` into the directory
3. Run `npm install` and then `npm start`
5. Head to `localhost:3000` in your browser  

## How to Use:
Sign up for an account and follow the link to create a trip. You'll be redirected to an interactive calendar to choose the dates you are available. After confirming your availability you'll be guided to a selection of budget options. Once that information is gathered, you'll be prompted to name and officially create your trip. A shareable URL will be generated which can easily be copied to your browser's clipboard. Share the link and wait for your friends to do the same!

## Future Directions
1. Implement a built-in emailing function that will send the link to recipients from within the browser.
2. Implement a more interactive calendar that will block off previously selected or overlapping dates.
